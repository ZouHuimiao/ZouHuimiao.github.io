  <h2>音符(Notes)</h2>
  <p>A musical note has several parts, including a note head, stem, and flag, that together indicate the duration (length) of the note. Notes of shorter duration than a quarter note have flags, and groups of shorter notes are joined together with beams.</p>
  <p>一个音符由几部分组成，包括符头，符干和符尾，共同表示了一个音符的延音长度。延音长度比四分音符还短的音符具有符尾，一组连续的短音符通过"横杠"相连。</p>
  <table class="illu-tb-s">
  	<tr class="tr-main-s">
  		<td>w</td>
  		<td>h</td>
  		<td>q</td>
  		<td>e</td>
  		<td>x</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Each note shown above is half the duration (length) of the note to its left. From left to right, the notes are whole note, half note, quarter note, eighth note, and sixteenth note.</p>
  <p>上述的音符相对于它左侧的音符都要少一半的延音。从左往右分别是，全音符，半音符，四分音符，八分音符，十六分音符。</p>
  <h2>休止符(Rests)</h2>
  <p>When you play music, the spaces between notes are just as important as the notes themselves. The space between notes are shown using rests. Rests, like notes, have different symbols for different lengths of time, and shorter rests use flags.</p>
<p>Each rest shown below is half the duration of the rest to its left. From left to right, the rests are whole rest, half rest, quarter rest, eighth rest, and sixteenth rest.</p>
